What do you tell people about your field of study at a party?

I'm changing the world by creating incredible artificial intelligence applications that build robust systems that incorporate big data and machine learning 
algorithms that can predict the future before it happens and can think through all of your thoughts you have thought of in your life in the matter of seconds. 

In the past month, what are the three main activities you have been doing at work/study?

procastinating, playing chess, and doing alot of stats homework. 


What are the three most important tools/strategies you use for organizing your work?

1. "eliminating fluff" when I get rid of the things in my life take large amount of time and energy and produce little long term benefits, I can get more work done and in turn live a happier life. 
2. using a planner, when I write something down with a box next to it I get it done, I have to much ocd to make a check mark box in my planner for something to get done and then leave the box empty. 
3. 3. chucking my work, big projects are hard to start because the "mountain" of work seems intimitating, but when you break it down and just think start by taking a small chuck and doing that first, this leads me to want to accomplish another task =, then another and so on.
