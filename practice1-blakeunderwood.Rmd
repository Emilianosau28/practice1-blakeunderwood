## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
df = read.csv("C:/Users/ublak/OneDrive/Desktop/DS_202/gapminder-5060.csv")
df
library(tidyverse)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
# Question 2: Generate the graph of LifExp vs. gdpPercap for US, Canada, Aussie's
```{r}
df1 = df1 %>% filter(country == "Canada")
df2 = df2 %>% filter(country == "United States")
df3 = df3 %>% filter(country == "Australia")
df1 = df1 %>% mutate(lifeExp = replace(lifeExp, lifeExp == 999999, 69.96))
ggplot(df1, aes(x=lifeExp, y = gdpPercap)) + geom_point()
ggplot(df2, aes(x=lifeExp, y = gdpPercap)) + geom_point()
ggplot(df3, aes(x=lifeExp, y = gdpPercap)) + geom_point()

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
